Javascript

* JavaScript is a common programing language to program the behavior of web pages.


* Js variables
	Using var
	Using let
	Using const
	var declarations are globally scoped or function
	 scoped while let and const are block scoped. var
	  variables can be updated and re-declared within its 
		  scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared;
			 const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
			  They are all hoisted to the top of their scope.


* JavaScript (Js) is a dynamically typed language, which means that data types of variables are determined by the value they 
hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them.


*  === vs ==
=== also checks if the datatypes are equal along with the data
while == checks only the values not the datatypes.
